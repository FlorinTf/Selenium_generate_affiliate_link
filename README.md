  I created this app to make my work easier.
I needed to generate different links in an affiliate program. 
That way, everyone can generate their own link without getting me involved :heavy_check_mark:!

The code is written in Python, I used Tkinter to create an environment for data entry and Selenium to automate the process.
The script accesses the page www.admitad.com and logs in to my account. Then access my partner store, submit the link and the name, to know who placed the order and from whom my commission comes. Generate a new affiliate link and open it in a new browser and then close the app.:arrows_counterclockwise:
